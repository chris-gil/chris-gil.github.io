    <p>Frank Atkinson designed the showroom for the Paris-based firm of Durant Motorcars manufacturers in 1914.</p>
    <p>He created a substitute interior which allowed the vehicles to be seen at the best.</p>
    <p>You could not control the shape of the site, however, which explains the slightly cramped system of display of order by the long narrow showroom.</p>

    <p>The Michelin building was designed by F. Espinasse. It was begun in 1905 and further extended in 1910.</p>
    <p>The company's merchandise was widely advertised by the architectural motifs on the motoring theme: 
    cupolas resembling piles of tyres, motor-car wheels in the pediments and tiled illustrations of cars and bicycles decorating the pillars.</p>
    <p>Even though the Michelin Man, no longer adorns the top of the main window, his origins are clearly implicit in the rest of the decor that survives.

    <p>Each floor had an electrically operated pressure washing plant for the cars.</p>
    <p>The garage is well lit, both naturally and artificially. Herbert Felton, 1931.
